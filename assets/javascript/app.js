// The game initially starts by pressing the Start Button
// Start a 30 second countdown clock - perhaps the getTime(). https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_countdown.asp
// At the same time, display one question
// At the same time, display multiple choice answers
// If correct answer is chosen, show a message saying "correct" and an image or gif
// If wrong answer is chosen, show a message saying "incorrect: and show an image or gif of the correct answer with text "the correct answer was...:"
// If time runs up, show "time is up" and show an image or gif of the correct answer with text "the correct answer was...:"
// After answer is shown (in any instance) wait 5 seconds and automatically show the next question
// Once all questions are answered, display scoreboard and a "Start Over" button 
// If "Start Over" button is clicked, a new game starts 
// At no point should a user refresh the page
// Thats all, easy, right?
